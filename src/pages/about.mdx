# About Aria Watch

![Borino PCB](https://r3-it.storage.cloud.it/aria-public/website/about.jpg)


Aria Watch is an open-source project born from a passion for environmental monitoring and a commitment to providing transparent, reliable air quality data. Our goal is to empower individuals and communities worldwide to understand their environment and take informed action against climate change.

---

## Our Mission

We believe that accurate, accessible environmental data is essential in the fight against climate change. Aria Watch aims to combat misinformation by offering precise air quality measurements through innovative, open hardware devices combined with a collaborative global network.

---

## The Device

Our devices are equipped with advanced sensors to measure multiple environmental factors, including carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. They are designed to be weather-resistant and user-friendly, featuring solar panels, easily replaceable filters, and secure enclosures with USB-C connectivity.

All designs, schematics, firmware, and assembly instructions are open and freely available to anyone wishing to build, modify, or improve their own Aria Watch device.

---

## Community and Experience

Aria Watch was proudly showcased at Maker Faire events, connecting with a vibrant maker community driven by curiosity and innovation. Our diverse and dedicated team, though unnamed here, brings together expertise in electronics, software, environmental science, and design, all fueled by a shared passion for making a positive environmental impact.

Beyond technology, Aria Watch fosters a collaborative community where users can share data, insights, and ideas to promote awareness and support climate action worldwide.
